# What is AJAX?
Ajax is an efficient way for loading data (sending and receiving http requests) without having to refresh the entire page, which is known as an asynchronous process model. Ajax can help speed up the run time of the program and improve the user experience.


# How to Make an AJAX Call
 ## A high-level overview of ajax calls can be broken down like so:

    1. The browser requests information from the server.
    2.  The server responds with data (html, xml, son)
    3. The browser processes the content sent back from the server and  adjusts the web page accordingly.
